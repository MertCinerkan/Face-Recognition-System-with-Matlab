# Face Recognition System with MATLAB

This project implements a face recognition system using MATLAB. It uses a pre-trained AlexNet model for feature extraction and a custom-trained SVM classifier for face prediction. The system detects faces in real-time using a webcam and predicts the identity of detected faces based on the trained model.

## Features
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Detects faces from live video feed captured by a webcam.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses AlexNet's `fc8` layer to extract features from detected faces.
- **Classification**: Predicts face identity using a trained SVM classifier.
- **Visualization**: Annotates detected faces and displays predictions on the live video feed.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (with Computer Vision Toolbox and Deep Learning Toolbox installed)
- A webcam connected to your computer
- Pre-trained AlexNet model (included in MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox)
- Trained SVM model (`trainedModelSVM.mat` file)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-matlab.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.
3. Ensure the required files (`trainedModelSVM.mat`) are in the same directory as the main script.
4. Connect a webcam to your computer.

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
   ```matlab
   run('face_recognition_system.m')
   ```
2. The system will start capturing frames from the webcam and performing face detection and recognition.
3. Detected faces will be annotated with bounding boxes and predicted labels.

## Code Description
- **`trainedModelSVM.mat`**: Pre-trained SVM model for classification.
- **AlexNet**: Pre-trained neural network used for feature extraction.
- **CascadeObjectDetector**: Used to detect faces in real-time.

### Main Script Workflow
1. Initialize the webcam and load the trained SVM model.
2. Use `CascadeObjectDetector` to detect faces in the video stream.
3. Extract features from detected faces using AlexNet's `fc8` layer.
4. Predict the identity of each detected face using the trained SVM model.
5. Display the annotated video stream with bounding boxes and predictions.

## Example Output
When a face is detected and recognized, the system displays the annotated video feed with a label indicating the predicted identity of the detected face.

## Notes
- Ensure the webcam is properly connected and recognized by MATLAB.
- The `trainedModelSVM.mat` file should be generated by training an SVM classifier on a labeled dataset of faces.
- The input size of AlexNet is fixed at 227x227 pixels; input images are resized accordingly.
